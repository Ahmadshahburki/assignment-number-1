            <h4>Protein</h4>
            <p>Crucial for muscle repair and growth, protein helps in recovery after workouts. Aim for lean sources like chicken, fish, eggs, and plant-based options like beans and lentils. Incorporating protein shakes post-workout can also be beneficial.</p>

            <h4>Complex Carbohydrates</h4>
            <p>These provide sustained energy for workouts. Foods like whole grains, oats, quinoa, and sweet potatoes release energy gradually, helping you maintain performance during longer training sessions.</p>

            <h4>Healthy Fats</h4>
            <p>Important for hormone regulation and overall health, healthy fats support sustained energy levels. Include sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. They can also help with nutrient absorption.</p>

            <h4>Hydration and Electrolytes</h4>
            <p>Staying hydrated is key for optimal performance. Water is essential, but during intense workouts, replenishing electrolytes (like sodium, potassium, and magnesium) through sports drinks or foods like bananas and coconut water can help prevent cramping and fatigue.</p>

            <h4>Vitamins and Minerals</h4>
            <p> Micronutrients play a vital role in energy production and muscle function. For example, B vitamins help convert food into energy, while minerals like calcium and magnesium support muscle contraction and bone health. A colorful diet rich in fruits and vegetables will provide a variety of these essential nutrients.</p>

            <h4>Fiber</h4>
            <p> While not directly tied to immediate workout performance, fiber is crucial for digestive health and maintaining steady energy levels. Foods high in fiber, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, can help keep you feeling full and support overall health, which is important for consistent training.</p>
